# Dark Mode

Lets your users make the WordPress admin dashboard darker.

## Contribute

If you would like to make WordPress more visually appealing in the dark, please contribute! Styling the entirety of the admin dashboard is a huge task we need people on hand to do it!

Ideally, Dark Mode will one day be a part of the WordPress Core. Until then, we need people to help design, build and test this feature to ensure it's up the standard of being included. Please submit pull requests with details of your changes into this repository for consideration.
